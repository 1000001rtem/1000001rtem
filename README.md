### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Artem Eremim. I'm a Java software engineer with over 5 years of experience. I have worked in the biggest banks in the country and have a lot of experience working on different projects like CRM for enterprise business, automated platform for personal loans and payments and transfers system for more than 5 millions clients.

I have a plenty of experience in creating and designing systems, focusing on their architecture and overall structure. My expertise extends to database design and BPMN systems. I have an extensive background in working with microservices based on Java/Kotlin and Spring Boot technology.

I have a lot of hands-on experience with technologies like Kafka, ArtemisMQ, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Docker, Camunda, Redis, WebFlux, Jooq, etc. I also have worked as a full-stack developer, so I am experienced with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Angular 10.

I enjoy learning and sharing knowledge with others. I'm a team player and believe in working together to get the best results. I believe in Agile ways of working and have worked in Scrum and Less teams for more than 5 years. I'm excited about the chance to explore new opportunities and make a positive impact.
